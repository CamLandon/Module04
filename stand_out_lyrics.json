"8 ContributorsStand Out Lyrics[Verse 1]\nOpen up your eyes\nTake a look at me\nGet the picture fixed in your memory\nI'm driven by the rhythm like the beat of a heart\nAnd I won't stop until I start\nTo stand out, to stand out\n\nSome people settle for the typical thing\nLivin' all their lives waiting in the wings\nIt ain't a question of \"if\"\nJust a matter of time\nBefore I move to the front of the line\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOnce you're watching every move that I make\nYou gotta believe that I got what it takes\n\n[Chorus]\nTo stand out\nAbove the crowd\nEven if I gotta shout out loud\n'Til mine is the only face you'll see\nGonna stand out 'til ya notice me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf the squeaky wheel's always gettin' the grease\nI'm totally devoted to disturbin' the peace\nAnd I'll do it all again when I get done\nUntil I become your number one\nYou might also likeNo method to the madness\nAnd no means of escape\nGonna break every rule or bend them all outta shape\nIt ain't a question of \"how\"\nJust a matter of when\nYou get the message that I'm tryin' to send\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI'm under a spell\nI'm in over my head\nAnd you know I'm going all of the way to the end\n\n[Chorus]\nTo stand out\nAbove the crowd\nEven if I gotta shout out loud\n'Til mine is the only face you see\nGonna stand out, 'til ya notice me\n\n[Bridge]\nIf I could make you stop\nAnd take a look at me\nInstead of just walkin' by\nThere's nothin' that I wouldn't do\nIf it was gettin' you to notice\nI'm alive\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll I need is half a chance\nA second thought\nA second glance\nTo prove, I got whatever it takes\nIt's a piece of cake\n\n[Chorus]\nTo stand out\nAbove the crowd\nEven if I gotta shout out loud\n'Til mine is the only face you'll see\nGonna stand out\nStand out (aayah)\n\n[Outro]\nStand out!\n(Yeah!)\nStand out!\n(Uh)\n'Til mine is the only face you'll see\nGonna stand out\n'Til ya notice me1Embed"
