"45 ContributorsThe Man Who Can\u2019t Be Moved Lyrics[Verse 1]\nGoing back to the corner where I first saw you\nGonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move\nGot some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand\nSaying, \"If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?\"\nSome try to hand me money, they don't understand\nI'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man\nI know it makes no sense, what else can I do?\nAnd how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me\nAnd your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be\nThinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet\nAnd you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street\nSo I'm not moving\nI'm not moving\n\n[Verse 2]\nPoliceman says, \"Son, you can't stay here\"\nI say, \"There's someone I'm waiting for\nIf it's a day, a month, a year\"\nGotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows\nIf she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me\nAnd your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be\nThinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet\nAnd you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street\nSo I'm not moving\nI'm not moving\nI'm not moving\nI'm not moving\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nPeople talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl, oh\nThere are no holes in his shoes, but a big hole in his world, mmm\nMaybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved\nAnd maybe you won't mean to, but you'll see me on the news\nAnd you'll come running to the corner 'cause you know it's just for you\nI'm the man who can't be moved\nI'm the man who can't be moved\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me (find you're missing me)\nAnd your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (oh, where on Earth I could be)\nThinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet, oh, oh)\nAnd you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street (on the corner of the street)\nSo I'm not moving\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me (I'm not moving)\nAnd your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (I'm not moving)\nThinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (I'm not moving)\nAnd you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street\n\n[Outro]\nGoing back to the corner\nWhere I first saw you\nGonna camp in my sleeping bag\nI'm not gonna move35Embed"
